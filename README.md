#  SOCIAL MEDIA FORENSIC TOOL FOR CYBERCRIME INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS USING AI
With the rise of cybercrimes such as identity theft, misinformation, cyberbullying, and online fraud, law enforcement agencies require advanced tools to analyze and investigate social media activities. The Social Media Forensic Tool for Cybercrime Investigation and Analysis Using AI is designed to extract, analyze, and visualize social media data to assist forensic experts in cyber investigations. By leveraging AI-driven techniques, this tool can detect suspicious activities, analyze patterns, and generate detailed reports to aid in cybercrime prevention and resolution.
# About
This project is a Streamlit-based AI-powered web application that retrieves and processes public social media data from platforms like Instagram and YouTube. It integrates web scraping, machine learning, and API-based data extraction to provide investigators with detailed insights into user activities, media interactions, and engagement metrics. The system employs natural language processing (NLP), anomaly detection, and deep learning algorithms to identify potential cyber threats.
# Key Features
1.Automated Social Media Data Extraction: Retrieves user profiles, posts, comments, and engagement metrics using APIs and web scraping.

2.AI-Powered Cybercrime Detection: Uses machine learning models to identify suspicious patterns, fake profiles, and hate speech.

3.Sentiment and Behavioral Analysis: Employs NLP to analyze user intent, sentiment, and interactions.

4.Visualization and Reporting: Generates interactive graphs, trend analysis reports, and dashboards for forensic examination.

5.Real-Time Monitoring: Provides live tracking of social media trends and flagged activities.

6.User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Streamlit, making it accessible for forensic analysts and law enforcement.
