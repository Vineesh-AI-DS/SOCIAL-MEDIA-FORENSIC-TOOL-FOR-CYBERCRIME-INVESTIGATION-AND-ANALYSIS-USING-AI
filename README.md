## Social Media Forensic Tool For Cybercrime Investigation And Analysis Using AI
With the rise of cybercrimes such as identity theft, misinformation, cyberbullying, and online fraud, law enforcement agencies require advanced tools to analyze and investigate social media activities. The Social Media Forensic Tool for Cybercrime Investigation and Analysis Using AI is designed to extract, analyze, and visualize social media data to assist forensic experts in cyber investigations. By leveraging AI-driven techniques, this tool can detect suspicious activities, analyze patterns, and generate detailed reports to aid in cybercrime prevention and resolution.
